4180,0,54,1e464379acaf4ea78279e7327a0adcc4,"In answering this second question the High Court has proceeded on two grounds : firstly, it has referred to s.5 of the Excess Profits Tax Act, 1940, particularly the third proviss thereto, and contracting the provisions of that section with s.5 of the Business Profits Tax Act of 1947 has expressed the view that neither of these provisions touched the question whether losses incurred in an Indian State could be taken into account in assessing the taxable income of an assessee in British India for purposes of assessing excess profits tax or business profits tax ; it then referred to the decision of the Bombay High Court in Karamchand Premchand Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay (2) and said: ""It would seem that inspite of the slightly different language of the Excess Profits Tax Act from that of the Income-tax Act, no distinction has ever been drawn in this matter between the principles governing assessment to income-tax and the principles governing assessment to excess profits tax and in fact it would appear to have been the universal (1) (1959) 36 I.T.R, 1.
(2) (1956)30I.T.R.849,          practice that decisions of the Income-tax authorities and High Courts have been followed by consequential orders relating to the same assessee's taxable income for the purpose of the Excess Profits Tax Act and the learned counsel for the Commissioner has not been able to cite any decision in which different principles have been applied in this particular matter.",Tax
4180,0,55,6167c81f6e7e4dafa6aeca55f61dc964,"Admittedly one of the reasons given in his judgment by Chagla C.J.
          for coming to the decision mentioned above 'was that the third proviso had been changed in the Business Profits Tax Act as compared with the Excess Profit-, Tax Act, but this is only one of a number of reasons and the questions has not been considered at all whether under the proviso in the Excess Profits Tax Act losses made in an Indian State could have been computed in assessing the assessee's income from business in British India.",Tax
4180,0,56,55db0ecda85b4c99a5ece1141943025c,"I can only say that in the circumstances it seems to me likely that if the point had arisen the same view that I.
          have expressed above would have been taken, namely, that whereas for the excess profits tax profits earned in an Indian State could not be taken into consideration at all, such profits could be taken into account if brought into taxable territories for assessing profits tax and that is regards losses.",Tax

4180,0,61,be05298d41e74cbe9d1c8ddaa8c7972c,"There is no Suggestion that the firm has any agent or branch in any native State and it therefore seems to me that whether profits result or losses are incurred as the result of transac- tions of this kind even with firms in Indian States, the profits accrue or the losses are incurred at the place where the payments are received or from which they are made, namely, the firm's place of business at Delhi.""",Tax

But however, the complainant was said to be cultivating the land throughout and therefore he negated the objection raised by the sons of Gurushantappa and had grown sugar cane in the said land and the brother of the complaint namely Sharanappa had obtained permission to supply sugar cane to the Bhusnoor sugar factory and had arranged for harvesting the sugar cane crop.",Criminal

4216,21,44,3e3563a4a2344e6c985af637ef94b1ef,"Therefore, in the absence of any such independent evidence on record, the testimony of the said witnesses has been characterized as being tutored and interested testimony, especially, when there are material contradictions as regards the weapons seized and the manner in which the same have stated to have been employed by the accused in assaulting the injured and which is contradictorily stated by the said witnesses.",Criminal
4216,21,45,b1011d04a43e4a02b39a2f4afd62ae10,"7. Further, PWs-4 and 5 had deposed that immediately after the incident they carried Sharanappa first to the police station and thereafter to the hospital.",Criminal
4216,21,46,b3292edddde5432da7b2412debe4493b,But the evidence of the Investigating Officer discloses that after he was informed of the incident he had come to the hospital and recorded the statement of the complainant.,Criminal
4216,21,47,3f9a1486aaee427fa8ae9e0b9d79f01d,"
This is yet another contradiction which has been disbelieved by the Court as to the manner in which the incident may have occurred.",Criminal
4216,21,48,da4bea2c9d404ce78031b800c28a6b55,"
Apart from these witnesses, there were other witnesses such as PW- 9 who was a circumstantial witness of the incident and the evidence of that witness was also of no help to the prosecution.",Criminal
4216,21,49,9afb99d2c464470d97af04c0a116b592,"8. Similarly, PW-6 who was the father of PW-1 had deposed that he was in his house at the time of the incident and when he visited the land, PW-1 had already been carried to the hospital for treatment and in this manner the Court below has discarded the evidence of this witness, apart from PWs-10, 12 and 14 who were all formal witnesses in respect of the panchanama and spot mahazar etc.",Criminal
4216,21,50,a75a506db02748cb888b59c0309aa63f,"In fact PWs-12 and 14 who are the panch witnesses and seizure mahazar, have not supported the prosecution case and they were treated as hostile witnesses.",Criminal
4216,21,51,452f94a05c8546fba1d37cb3a8a0f0c7,"9. Further, the Court below has discussed the evidence of PW- 3, the Medical practitioner of the Government Hospital, Aland, who had stated that Sharanappa was brought by one Nagappa for treatment and that he had been assaulted with an axe and a knife and the doctor has spoken about the serious injuries which were identified as seven in number and that the patient was shifted to a larger hospital as the injuries were very grievous in nature.",Criminal
4216,21,52,4b5495c5dd1e428e855cc0644a59326d,"Though the medical evidence clearly indicated that the victim had suffered grievous injuries, the evidence of the other witnesses was not consistent in the manner as to how those injuries were caused.",Criminal
4216,21,53,f66cff5e9c69499d91635991b02f4b49,10. PW-1 deposed that there was a property dispute between his father and father of accused No.1.,Criminal
4216,21,54,cc1372c84c8f423a8281eceee337d460,"He has narrated that accused No.1 assaulted him with an axe on his right palm, as a result of which the thumb got severed and accused No.2 assaulted him with an axe on his right palm and also on the wrist of his left hand and accused No.1 repeated his assault with the axe on the left portion of his chest, thereafter he had lost consciousness.",Criminal
4216,21,55,feba90c8fe484d5887acbcf615fb05cd,"He had further stated that when accused Nos.1 and 2 had attacked him, there was none present on the land and that at the time of the incident accused No.3 was carrying water to her house.",Criminal
4216,21,56,9b93399455ef49a783081c281dd28463,"However, in his cross- examination he had denied that accused No.3 was present at all.",Criminal
4216,21,57,14cdae5c79a7485cb4ad62ded9516c69,"
On which he was treated as a hostile witness and the prosecution has cross-examined him on that aspect.",Criminal
4216,21,58,c245b5c831804012a0c287448edca8af,"
 11. PW-5 who is the son of PW-1 had stated that accused No.1 had assaulted PW-1 on his right palm with the sword as a result of which the thumb was severed and he and PW-4 intervened.
Accused No.2 had threatened him with the axe thereafter accused No.2 continued to assault his father with an axe on the left hand causing injuries.",Criminal
4216,21,59,3ed707ccf6fb4a57a9c0b767d3d7a3d6,Accused No.2 also caused injury on the left shoulder and thereafter he had lost consciousness.,Criminal
4216,21,60,bbf05aebbc024a3099e06cfcd5772aae,That accused No.3 was all along exhorting accused Nos.1 and 2 to murder Sharanappa.,Criminal
4216,21,61,86d61fe7a543473f802cd0be8449e8e7,"
 12. Given these inconsistencies in the case of the prosecution, though it cannot be denied that PW-1 had suffered serious injuries, since the manner in which the incident had unfolded and the participation of the accused, as alleged, being inconsistently narrated by the witnesses, the trial Court has rightly felt that it was not possible to reconcile the inconsistencies and contradictions and therefore has held that prosecution has failed to bring home the charges beyond all reasonable doubt as against the accused and has acquitted them.",Criminal
4216,21,62,2bd6956e033a4e2eb893793e465511ff,"Though the learned Additional Advocate General would make an effort to salvage the case, as could be seen from the evidence tendered, it is full of inconsistencies which cannot be reconciled and the trial Court has rightly acquitted the accused on the grounds as stated.",Criminal
4216,21,63,b1aff2c02ddc48839e125974ff2c6820,"
 13. Hence, there is no substance in this appeal and the same stands dismissed.",Criminal

Two other conditions for the applicability of this Clause, according to the Counsel, are: (a) that the testimony in question had been obtained under compulsion, and (b) it relates to the offence of which he stands formally accused.",Tax
4178,24,46,b316bb01ffdc46a883ded8ec85f0f5df,"
These conditions, it is maintained, were not fulfilled in the present case.",Tax

4178,24,48,4f6015a0b7904d28838f4faea1ea1c8c,"
         From an analysis of this clause, it is apparent that in order to claim the benefit of the guarantee against testimonial compulsion embodied in this clause, it must be shown, firstly, that the person who made the statement was ""accused of any offence"" secondly, that he made this statement under compulsion.",Tax
4178,24,49,516b9138690b4d9fa7962d2a03278c9e,"The phrase ""accused of any offence"" has been the subject of several decisions of this Court so that by now it is well settled that only a person against whom a formal accusation relating to the commission of an offence has been levelled which in the normal course may result in his prosecution, would fall within its ambit.",Tax

4178,24,52,93484f80e72e48d9821e380dfb2bd300,This contention was repelled.,Tax
4178,24,53,3aafe695897f4accb017ac7ea5a934d1,"Shah J., speaking for the Court, made these apposite observations: ""Under s. 171-A of the Sea Customs Act, a Customs officer has power in an enquiry in connection with the smuggling of goods to summon any person whose attendance he considers necessary, to give evidence or to produce a document or any other thing, and by cl.

4178,24,56,361d868a636c4f7a911ecc093d9943cb,The steps taken by the Customs officer are for the purpose of holding an enquiry under the Sea Customs Act and for adjudging confiscation of goods dutiable or prohibited and imposing penalties.,Tax
4178,24,57,ca587070d0184166b2ff57f773fe2ec6,The Customs officer does not at that stage accuse the person suspected of infringing the provisions of the Sea Customs Act with the commission of any offence.,Tax

4178,24,59,4cfc5429b0794d24a0f038a61be789a8,"
         After a survey of case law, the Court pointed out the circumstances, the existence of which is ordinarily necessary to clothe a person with the character of a ""person accused of an offence"": ""Normally a person stands in the character of an accused when a First Information Report is lodged.
         against him in respect of an offence before an officer competent to investigate it, or when a complaint is made relating to the commission of an offence before a Magistrate competent to try or send to another Magistrate for trial the offence.",Tax

4178,24,62,e44de0ea4b814a19bb9016ecd72a33fc,The above-quoted observations are a complete answer to the contention of the appellant.,Tax
4178,24,63,affa2dbded8f4fe4aaad3988e363ac2d,"In the light of these principles, it is clear that when the statement of the appellant was recorded by the Customs officer under s. 108, the appellant was not a person ""accused of any offence""
under the Customs Act, 1962.",Tax

4178,24,65,4fbe75dce4ba4313a5abb063132f35c5,"
         True, that the appellant was arrested by the police on December 12, 1967 on suspicion of having committed an offence under s. 124, of the Bombay Police Act and a Panchnama of the packages in the truck was also prepared.",Tax
4178,24,66,36b94c702ca041499a868f61a31499e2,"
But the factual ingredients of that offence are materially different from those of an offence under the Customs Act.",Tax
4178,24,67,d069cb5e22ba41a0ac79eeed591f600c,"
 This will be apparent from a bare reading of s. 124 of the Bombay Police Act, which provides : ""Whoever has in his possession or conveys in any manner, or offers for sale or pawn, anything which there is         reason to believe is stolen property or property fraudulently obtained shall, if he fails to account for such possession or to act to the satisfaction of the Magistrate, on conviction, be punished with imprisonment for a term (which may extend to one year but shall not, except for reasons to be recorded in writing, be less taken one month and shall also be liable to the fine which may extend to five hundred rupees).
         Even in respect of that offence, the police did not register any case or enter any F.I.R. which normally furnishes a foundation for commencing a police investigation.",Tax
4178,24,68,c6e6de0a8b0c4525b03e6f5426dfa69b,The police did not open the packages or prepare inventories of the goods packed therein.,Tax

4178,24,73,ff4a3da2f73444d7a5285a71f2da9724,"
Under the circumstances it was manifest that at the time when the Custom officer recorded the statement of the appellant, the latter was not formally ""accused of any offence.""",Tax
4178,24,74,655ee00d43bc4d6983cd5b622eb8f39a,The High Court was therefore right in holding that the statement recorded by the Inspector of Customs was not hit by Article 20(3) of the Constitution.,Tax
4178,24,75,f0a4e90102d94eb1b56901aa8dcfc56c,"The next question to be considered is, whether this statement was hit by s. 24 of the Evidence Act.",Tax
4178,24,76,e2b9ea44b19547c8861cbc7537e739df,The contention is that this statement was obtained under compulsion of law inasmuch as he was required to state the truth under threat of prosecution for perjury.,Tax

         To attract the prohibition enacted in s. 24, Evidence Act, these facts must be established: (i) that the statement in question is a confession; (ii) that such confession has been made by an accused person; (iii)that it has been made to a person in authority; (iv) that the confession has been obtained by reason of any inducement, threat or promise proceeding from a person in authority; (v) such inducement, threat or promise, must have reference to the charge against the accused person; (vi) the inducement, threat or promise must in the opinion of the Court be sufficient to give the accused person grounds, which would appear to him reasonable, for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him.",Tax

4178,24,90,3c7409114656492f890e4002512fe6c8,"
         For these reasons, it could be said beyond doubt, that the statement Ex. 1 was not a ""confession"" within the meaning of s. 24, Evidence Act.",Tax
4178,24,91,5ad84686f8524ecbb33cd0df8fc494e4,"
         Secondly, it has not been shown that the Customs officer-though a person in authority-had offered any inducement or held out any threat or promise to the appellant.",Tax
4178,24,92,fe9169ba57a2455384e4d7cf45573055,"
         Christopher Soares, the Inspector of (Customs (P. W. 4) testified that no threats, coercion or inducements were used and that the statement Ex. 1 was made by the appellant, voluntarily.

4178,24,93,283d176b869f477b9ccb70ef3d2f9e83,"While it may be conceded that a person summoned by an officer of Customs to make a statement under s. 108 of the Customs Act, is under compulsion of law to state the truth, the compulsion there under, assuming it amounts to a threat, does not proceed ""from a person in authority"" within the contemplation of s. 24, but emanates from law.",Tax
4178,24,94,517608aab7194c54a4e4f72458f5d3f8,"
         Thirdly, the mere fact that the Inspector of Customs had, before recording the statement, warned the deponent of the possibility of hisprosecution for perjury in case he did not make the statement truthfully, cannot be construed as a threat held out by the officer which could have reasonably caused the person making the statement to suppose that he would by making that statement, gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him for smuggling.

         Lastly, Mr. Chaudhry tried to contend that the incriminating facts admitted in Ex. 1 taken along with the other facts appearing in the evidence of prosecution witnesses, were insufficient to establish an offence under s. 135, Customs Act against the appellant because no notification under sub-s. (2) of s. 123, of the Customs Act had been issued in respect of the import of the goods of the kind seized, and the aid of the statutory presumption under that section was not available to the prosecution.

4082,29,6,04fc9ef44ede4c5abae74a91cbb7a837,"2. The petitioner is a registered dealer under the provisions of the Karnataka Value Added Tax Act, 2003 (Hereinafter referred to as the `KVAT Act', for brevity) and is engaged in the manufacture and sale of rice bran oil, cotton seed oil, sunflower oil and soya oil, by employing solvent extraction process out of rice bran, cotton seed, sunflower cake, and soya seeds.",Tax

4082,29,9,0e73f79bd3bc45b7806ff86fece32d55,"In the said returns filed, the petitioner had claimed partial input rebate in terms of section 17 of the KVAT Act in respect of rice bran, cotton seed, sunflower cake and soya seeds used as input in the extraction of oil on the understanding of the law while filing returns that it was not eligible for full input tax rebate.",Tax
4082,29,10,455277b33d2c4c4f90d322b70fd7d1c7,The said returns are deemed as accepted under section 38(1) of the KVAT Act.,Tax
4082,29,11,aa648681d8954a92aa3d3aa51c66b8c8,"
 3. The first respondent audited the books of account for the tax periods April 2006 to March 2007, April 2007 to March 2008, April 2008 to March 2009 and April 2009 to March 2010 and had passed re-assessment orders under section 39(1) of the KVAT Act levying tax, penalty and interest.",Tax
4082,29,12,f4c3403d18044b33b35b8ab4b83f7c13,"In doing so, the prescribed authority had allowed the partial input rebate as per Section 17 of the KVAT Act, on the value of inputs namely, rice bran, cotton seed, sunflower cake and soya seed used in the extraction of oil on the understanding of law that the petitioner is not eligible for full input tax rebate.",Tax
4082,29,13,6fe229681c034cfc8ce9043bfccea9cc,"
 4. Subsequent to the filing of the returns, a division bench of this court has rendered its judgment in M.K.Agro Tech Private Limited vs. State of Karnataka, 2014(18) KLJ 1, to the effect that when an assessee is in the business of manufacture of only one product, namely, oil and which is liable to tax, merely because in the process of manufacture of oil, certain by-product arises, which is sold and which is exempted from tax, that would not attract the provisions of Section 17 of the KVAT Act relating to partial rebate.",Tax
4082,29,14,85f163a75e424eafbe4f4ae455a20263,"This was the declaratory of the law and according to the petitioner, would always have been applicable to all assessments made prior to and after the date of the said judgment.",Tax
4082,29,15,a45fb658fb9c421d92d978cdd0ed3e19,"Therefore, the petitioner has filed an application under Section 69(1) relating to the tax period April 2006 to March 2007, April 2007 to March 2008, April 2008 to March 2009 and April 2009 to March 2010 before the first respondent, for rectification of the re-assessment orders and to grant full input tax rebate on the value of VAT.",Tax
4082,29,16,dafc389182224cca8c7520c0607e7a2c,"That was rejected only on the ground that the petitioner ought to have made a claim for full tax rebate in the first instance and no such claim having been made would preclude it from doing so, since such a claim could have been made only within a period of six months and not beyond that and",Tax
4082,29,17,2616efc19d0948ffb2adf061c22f4515,"hence, the question of considering the case of the petitioner for such full tax rebate would not arise.",Tax
4082,29,18,d83f90189aa344c2aaf22a835e698472,"Insofar as the judgment in M.K.Agro Tech, supra, is concerned, it is applied in favour of the assesses from the date of judgment and there can be no second opinion, though the revenue has sought to challenge the same before the apex court and is pending consideration.",Tax
4082,29,19,8df675701e884783ae97691d6cd6012b,"5. The learned Government Advocate, while justifying the order, would submit that the question of rectification would not arise and it is a misconception on the part of the petitioner that they could file such a rectification application within a period of five years.",Tax
4082,29,20,e99bccdcfec2459a9b2ea6ba3d33ac1a,"Since the statute was clear even as on the date the claim was made and in the absence of any such claim, the petitioner now seeking to raise such a claim by hindsight, notwithstanding that it is only after the judgment was delivered by a division bench in M.K.Agro Tech, supra, in that, it has dawned on the petitioner that it could have made such an application, cannot be countenanced and seeks to contend that if any such benefit is given, the revenue would suffer serious loss.",Tax
4082,29,21,6fa3640591ab484ea2d0a76eba7bfab8,"
 6. By way of reply, the learned Senior Advocate would point out that it is unfair on the part of the revenue to contend that such a claim should have been made in the first instance and that the petitioner is precluded from raising such a claim as on date, as it was a mutually understood position of law which prevented the assessees from raising such claim.",Tax
4082,29,22,c527efec0f51440b80962e8dc88ad2d9,"For otherwise, if such claim had been made, it was quite possible that they would have been penalized for making such a claim and it is only on the legal position being settled by a decision of a division bench of this court that the benefit available to the petitioner has dawned on the petitioner and therefore, the rectification application was justified.",Tax
4082,29,23,6c50f9afd32d4385b4604c11fee78704,7. The point for consideration would be whether the petitioner could avail the benefit of the judgment which was rendered much after the assessment order was passed and whether such reassessment orders can be passed on their prayer for rectification of the earlier assessment.,Tax
4082,29,24,8bb4cf63ce3146569681460be4f63380,"
 8. In the above circumstances, in a situation where if the revenue were to be in the position of the assessee and if it was discovered that by virtue of the operation of law, the revenue was entitled to a certain amount from the dealers, it would have certainly turned the tables on the assessee and proceeding on that presumption, it would be only just and fair to direct the revenue to consider the prayer of the petitioner for rectification, when there is no dispute that they were entitled to full tax rebate by virtue of the decision in M.K.Agro Tech, supra.",Tax
4082,29,25,6d7050c987c1494d807de43ee8b34fc2,It would be a formality for the respondent to pass a rectification order and grant full tax rebate to the petitioner in terms of its prayer.,Tax
4082,29,26,23e5691442904cd5a55dd0e0cbae9555,The petitions are allowed.,Tax
4082,29,27,17a96e7c8dd447d68e93c3ba1c5b9ef4,"The impugned orders are set aside with direction to the first respondent to redo the same and give the petitioner the full benefit of the judgment in M.K.Agro Tech, supra.",Tax
4082,29,28,f75ab54ab8e54c70b5201013bfbd676e,"
