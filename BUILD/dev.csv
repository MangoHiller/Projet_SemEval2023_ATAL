4175,237,47,aa26c8947b33499288d36fe78b506ab1,"As rightly pointed out by the learned Counsel for the petitioners, Section 320 IPC, which describes ""Grievous hurt"", gives 8 possible kinds of hurt which may be characterised as grievous hurt, the injuries caused to PW2 do not fall within any of those categories and from a description of the injuries they may be charaterised only as simple injuries which were not likely to cause the death of the victim, in which event, it could not be said that an offence punishable under Section 326 IPC had been committed by the petitioners 1 and 2 and at best it was an offence punishable under Section 324 IPC.",Criminal,ANALYSIS
4175,237,48,3b0116b42d3447aaa4da600c9dc5a903,"Therefore, the conviction of the petitioners for an offence punishable under Section 326 IPC is misplaced and is not supported by the material evidence on record.",Criminal,ANALYSIS

33 by substituting the words "" Goods sold by the State

The appellant, a contractor doing business in the
construction of buildings and roads for the Military and
Public Works Department in the State of Madhya Pradesh,
challenged the validity of the assessment which the
respondent proposed to make on the appellant under the
provisions of the Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act,
1947, on the grounds (1) that the Provincial Legislature had
no authority under Entry 48 Of List II, Sch. VII of the
Government of India Act, 1935, to impose a tax on the supply
of materials in works contracts and that the provisions of
that Central Provinces and Berar Sales Tax Act which sought

to impose a tax thereon treating it as a sale were ultra
vires, and (2) that he was entitled to exemption under item
33 in Sch. 11, to tile Act and that the notification of the
Government dated September 18, 1950, withdrawing that
exemption was bad as being an unconstitutional delegation of
legislative authority :
Held, that the expression ""sales of goods"" in Entry 48 has
the same meaning which it had in the Indian Sale of Goods
Act, 1930, that in a building contract there is no sale of
materials as such, and that it is therefore ultra vires the
powers of the Provincial Legislature to impose tax on the
supply of materials.
